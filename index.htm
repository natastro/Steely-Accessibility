      <p>This project aims to provide an affordable and sustainable process model and design toolkits that can co-create the Northern Kentucky University Steely Library website for all (i.e., information accessibility).</p>
      <h4>Project Goal & Scope</h4>
      <p>The participatory design is related to the inclusion of end users as full participants in a design process to achieve better understanding of the users [1]. This important foundation facilitates the user centered perspective in the institute. With this project, we aim to model the participatory design process for the accessibility of the NKU Steely Library. 
Accessible information technology has been reinforced under federal law Section 508 to protect the rights of individuals with disabilities [2]. To install accessibility into the digital library in NKU, this project aims to provide a design toolkit that helps students explore, evaluate, and be involved in the participatory design process. Specific solutions and outcomes of this project include: 
<ul>
  <li>Accessibility audit and testing of the NKU Steely Library website</li> 
  <li>Participatory design practice and process modeling</li> 
  <li>Development of a design toolkit for iterative prototyping and evaluation</li>
</ul></p>
      <h4>Project Background & Motivation</h4>
      <p>By 2017, more than a few universities in the U.S. were filed under a complaint about their inaccessible websites. These cases include institutions such as University of Cincinnati, University of Montana, Louisiana Tech University, South Carolina Technical College System, and Penn State University. The higher education institutions are responsible for accessible information technology. The U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights (OCR) and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) support such a movement under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act [2].</p>
      <p>By definition, web accessibility is related to the feedback from people with a broad range of disabilities such as visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, and neurological challenges. Anyone who wants to utilize the website to obtain information should be able to use it without major difficulty. Yet, the NKU Steely Library needs to enhance the accessibility of its website. It has been challenging with listening to the users and improving the interface/interaction design accordingly. This is mainly due to the lack of a sustainable model of the participatory (design) process. For example, it is not easy to initiate the process by involving students and faculty members with disability. Most importantly, it is challenging to claim the value of users’ evaluation and to claim the necessity to listen users’ feedback. It was often questioned whether the library needs to allocate in extra resources and efforts to include the user’s voice in the design/development process. This is partly due to the misunderstanding of disability in small, extreme cases but not as the universal human condition in diversity.</p>
      <p>In short, improving web accessibility of Steely Library involves not only specific techniques or guidelines but also a continuous ongoing iterative process. How to improve web accessibility of NKU Steely Library is, therefore, a question about how to establish a co-creative design process with people around the academic library. We hope our research can contribute to modeling a process and assess the methods in diverse contexts, especially in aiming for accessible information for everyone.<p>
      <h4>Project Process:</h4>
      <ol type="1">
        <li>Conducting a basic literature review:
          <p>Literature review focusing on 1) the participatory and co-creative process and 2) the current guideline, recommendation, and regulation of accessible technology.</p></li>
        <li>Modeling the participatory/co-creative process for the accessible website:
          <p>Description of the initial model of the participatory design process and methods.
          <br>Workshop planning with the detailed information about the time/place/and the list of participants (with their requirement/qualification)</p></li>
        <li>Conducting an accessibility audit and/or testing 
	  <p>Accessibility audit with the latest version of the Steely Library website
          <br>Analyzing the results</p></li>
        <li>Implementing a participatory/co-creative process: workshop
          <p>A workshop or similar research methods in the participatory design framework will be conducted. The output of this practice will be one of the following prototypes: either a  low-fidelity prototype (on paper, for example) or high-fidelity prototype (on screen, in an interactive digital medium) to illustrate the ideas of workflow and wireframes.</p></li>
         <li>Design toolkits
           <p>An online document will be prepared to report the process and byproduct of this project. 
           <br>The result and findings will be consolidated to create design toolkits for students.
           <br>The website will be created to report the results and initial prototype of the design toolkits.</p></li>
      </ol>
      <h4><b>Literature Review (1):</b> Participatory and co-creative process modeling</h4>
        <p>The participatory design is based on the concept of the inclusion that “the users of artifacts are involved in their design as informants or co-designers” because users “have a democratic right to be included in the design of what affects them and will benefit as a result, and that including them in design activities results in better (e.g., more efficient, usable, profitable etc.) products and systems” (Bowen, 2010, p. 2). In designing the accessible technology, the participatory design is influential because the users can uncover the design challenges that may have been overlooked by designers or developers. The interest in participatory design has been increasing (Sanders, 2008; Halskov & Hansen, 2015; recent reference) - such as how to define participation, how to select the participants, how to evaluate the result, how to interpret the participants’ data, or how to share the attribution of the intellectual property derived from the collaboration (Vines et al, 2012). Especially, the current study is interested in modeling of participatory process, how to initiate the participation in design process and how to maintain the participation in the iterative process.
        <p>There are two approaches to the users’ participation: user centered design (i.e., “user as subject”) vs. participatory approach (i.e., “user as partner”). In the former approach, the interaction with users are often conducted by trained researchers, with a well structured form of observation, interview, or instructed task performance. On the other hand, in participatory design research, users are considered as an expert in their workspace and take an initiative role of ideation and conceptualization of the possible design solutions in the early design phases. 
(definition of process, and process modeling? and design process modeling) 
In terms of process, three types of models can be reviewed: product-driven, user-driven, and tool-driven process. 
        <p>User Centered Design (i.e., UCD, ISO 9241-210) process entails an iterative design process of 1) planning, 2) requirement analysis, 3) design & implementation, and 4) evaluation. Research suggests various participatory methods to collect user’s opinions and ideas in the early design process (references) but the challenges of “including multiple voices in design” (reference, p.)  as well as the disagreement between the expert’s knowledge and the user’s experience. It is a question on how to weigh (under a certain “power structure”) the voice of participants in the final design decisions (Druin, 2002; Luck, 2003; Reyman et al., 2005; Yamauchi, 2009).

        <p>One main weakness, however, relates to the criticism about the effectiveness of the methods (Muller, 2003).</p>
